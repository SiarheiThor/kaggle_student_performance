Following are examples of hyper-parameter changes that might help with the situation. Try them in order: (1) Decrease the 'shrinkage rate' parameter (default value of 0.1). For example divide its value by 2. (2) Decrease the 'num_candidate_attributes_ratio' hyper-parameter (default value of 1) by 80%. (3) Increase the early_stopping_num_trees_look_ahead parameter (e.g., try multiplying it by a factor of 2). (4) Use a more expensive but stable version of early stopping with 'early_stopping=MIN_LOSS_FINAL'.
